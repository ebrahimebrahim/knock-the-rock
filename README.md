# Knock the Rock

To build in linux download Godot and set the environment variable `GODOT` to point to your Godot executable.
```export GODOT=<path to your Godot application>```
Then run the script `make.sh` in the repository.

Version string and dev/release setting is done directly in `ktr/Globals.gd`.
